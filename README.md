## About this project

I wrote most of this code in 2018 during my stay in Pisa, Italy, while I was a post-doctoral researcher working with Prof. Alessandro Lenci, in the Computational Linguistics Laboratory (https://colinglab.fileli.unipi.it/), Department of Philology, Literature, and Linguistics, University of Pisa.

Its purpose was to tackle the task of parsing a large corpus of texts using CoreNLP (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) to segment the text at the word level and provide linguistic annotations such as enhanced ++ universal dependencies.

The strategy that is adopted here to address the issue of size is to split the corpus in multiple files and then process them in parallel using multiprocessing.

The code contains a 'preprocessor' to first split a corpus in different text files. Then the rest of the code can be used to parse them. A 'config_reader' is used to specify parameters to run the code.

As shown in the scripts folder, this code has been used for the following corpora or projects:

- BNC
- FakeNews
- LAMBADA
- SICK
- SNLI
- ukWaC
- Wiki2009
- Wiki2018



## State of the code

The code contains some bits resulting from trials and errors, hasn't been cleaned and should probably be refactored. It also contains some working documents used at the time of working on the project that may be out of date. A proper documentation should be written.

Unfortunately I haven't had the time to do all that yet.

Feel free to inspect the project and use it as you see fit (but at your own perils).


## License

The code is distributed under the Unlicense (i.e., it belongs to the public domain).

## Communication


If using the code played a substantial role in your own project, please be kind enough to acknowledge this by simply citing the URL of the repository.

I imagine that projects such as this one already exist but at the time of writing it I did not find any that would suit my problem, so I engineered this solution. I would be grateful if someone would show me where I could find better code to accomplish the same task.

Please don't hesitate to write to me if you have questions regarding the code or suggestions for improvements.




## Output format

The output format I use through CoreNLP is a variant of CoNLL-U.

It is slightly more concise than CoNLL-U.

It also includes enhanced ++ universal dependencies (UD).

Enhanced ++ UD are described in this paper:

Schuster, S., & Manning, C. D. (2016). Enhanced English Universal Dependencies: An Improved Representation for Natural Language Understanding Tasks. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016) (pp. 2371â€“2378). Retrieved from http://nlp.stanford.edu/~sebschu/pubs/schuster-manning-lrec2016.pdf



More information on universal dependencies: http://universaldependencies.org



The file format has one dependent (token/child) per line.



For each line, we have the following columns:

- index
- word
- lemma
- POS
- named entity
- UD dependencies



Note 1 :

Examples of named entities:

PERSON, TITLE, LOCATION (or O if there is none)



Note 2 :

'UD dependencies' is a comma-separated list of RELATION_NAME=HEAD_INDEX pairs

Example: nsubj=2,nsubj:xsubj=4




## Output examples

Most of the sentences that were parsed here were found in Schuster & Manning (2016).
