Obernberger Seebach

The Obernberger Seebach, formerly called Obernberger Ache, is a river in Austria originating south-west of Brenner and taking a north-east route to the Sill River. In the middle of the valley the brook passes through the village of Obernberg am Brenner. From the spring to the junction with the Sill it falls more than 200 metres in a V-shaped valley. It provides the village with drinking water thanks to its Grade A quality. In the lower course live fishes such as trout. 

Even though the brook is tiny, it has a high flow volume (approximately 10–15 m³/s). It was quite feared in the past because of its high water. The brook was mitigated at dangerous points. Its natural environment is nevertheless fairly unchanged.
