Demonstrating the value of defending Employment Tribunal Claims as opposed to settling automatically Confidential Our client has been a client of the firm for many years but has only instructed the Employment Team for the past 18 months . 

Despite having thousands of employees , the client had a policy never to fight an Employment Tribunal claim , choosing to settle them in every case . 

BPE persuaded the client to defend a case at Tribunal for the first time . 

Following BPE 's advice , the claim was struck out at the pre-hearing review . 

This result has caused the client to review its policy entirely and they will now be seeking BPE 's support to defend future claims rather than automatically settle .
