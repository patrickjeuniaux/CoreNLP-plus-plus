INoPSU was established in 1998 to provide a mechanism for individual paediatric surveillance units across the world to be able to compare and share data about uncommon rare childhood diseases and paediatric surveillance . 

Using the methodology devised by the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health that is " the use of active case ascertainment via a monthly mailing " , the units provide an efficient , effective framework for case finding for investigators who wish to study uncommon rare conditions in children . 

Fourteen countries now contribute to the activities of INoPSU . 

All units contact each other for results , sharing of protocols , putting researchers in touch with each other and a common international report is shared as part of national reports . 

The Network covers a child population of over 50 million children and to date has surveyed over 120 different rare paediatric disorders .
