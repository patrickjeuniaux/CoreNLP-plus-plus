What you are like and who you are looking for Lunar Park by Bret Easton Ellis I' 'd like to think I' 'm friendly , happy , intelligent , and interested in the world around me . 

I go to gigs far too often and the theatre not often enough . 

I like proper novels with old-fashioned covers and wandering round an art gallery on a rainy Sunday afternoon . 

I also like Columbia Road flower market , unpretentious pubs , jumping around in mud in the countryside , and spiders - in no particular order . 

I' 've few real dislikes , but I reserve a special place in my heart for hatred of the Daily Mail and celebrity culture . 

Apart from that I try to remain open minded about most things ... I don''t think I have a type as such ( ok , tall , dark and handsome isn''t a bad place to start ! 

) but intelligence and passion are always winners with me , as is honesty , being comfortable in your own skin , and most importantly , having the confidence to stand up for what you believe in .
