Count Nicholas Ludvig von Zinzendorf ( 1700-60 ) was born at Herrnhut in Germany . 

He was raised by his grandmother and was educated at a Pietist school , Wittenberg University and the University of Utrecht where he studied law and politics . 

Zinzendorf served as a councillor to the Elector of Saxony and preached in his spare time . 

In 1722 he purchased the estate of Berthelsdorf from his grandmother and offered it as a place of refuge for Moravian refugees from Silesia . 

Although he remained a committed member of the Lutheran Church , Zinzendorf encouraged the Moravians to re-establish their Brethren . 

He resigned his post at the Saxon court in 1727 and henceforth devoted all his time to the needs of the community . 

In 1734 Zinzendorf was ordained , in the apparent hope that he could establish a Moravian branch of the Lutheran Church . 

These plans came to nothing and he was exiled by the Saxon government although the Brethren were not banned . 

In exile , he devoted much time to fostering overseas missions in the West Indies and elsewhere . 

During a visit to England in 1737 he was introduced to Archbishop Potter and later that year in Berlin he was consecrated a Moravian bishop , with a responsibility which was defined four years later as that of general warden of the church . 

Zinzendorf visited England again in 1741 and met with John Wesley to discuss theological differences . 

In the same year , he visited North America and remained there for two years , serving as a Lutheran pastor in Phladelphia while attempting to organise German Protestant congregations in Pennsylvania into an ecumenical synod . 

Upon his return to Germany , he tried to re-establish closer links with the Lutherans and took part in an ill-starred mission to Russia . 

From 1749 to 1755 , Zinzendorf based himself in London . 

His attempts to secure parliamentary recognition of the Moravians as an ' ancient Protestant Episcopal Church ' were ultimately successful , but the costs incurred , brought the church to the brink of bankruptcy . 

Zinzendorf returned to Herrnhut in 1755 and surrendered some of his powers . 

His death occurred after a period of declining health .
