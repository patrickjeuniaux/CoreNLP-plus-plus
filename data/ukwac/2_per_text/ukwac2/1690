Therese Nicholson ( 82.41.34.214 ) on Monday , June 26 , 2006 - 12:35 am : Hi Tilly , Trez again - hope the kits & parents are doing well - just to say that we are giving up trying re : Homing 2 of your kittens - Have had no contact from you so must assume that we are no longer being considered - I really have to be able to make plans for the summer & for my boys - a catless house is not a happy one for us - Am arranging for rescue cats . 

Many thanks Trez By Therese Nicholson ( 82.41.34.214 ) on Wednesday , May 31 , 2006 - 07:31 pm : Hi Tilly , Therese - thanks for messaging - you must be having a cuddle break if your reading this - Home check would be absolutely fine - How to do this ? 

- we are available during the day too as we work from home . 

Reference for family from Vet also no prob ' We would prefer 2 males - just because it seems from what I 've read that as long as they are spayed they get-on better - However , one boy & one girl would be fine also - pref ' not 2 girls . 

It really depends on which ones you feel are well bonded to each other . 

We would have them spayed etc. a.s.a.p. & Vet can confirm . 

We are in Edinburgh and could make the journey as a holiday break to London ( step-daughter 's ) then to Reading & they same for return to Scotland - so not too long a journey for the kits .

By lynn beddoe ( 217.169.41.118 ) on Thursday , May 11 , 2006 - 03:15 pm : Hi Tilly , I would like to take on two kittens , and happy to pay towards mother cat 's spay . 

I have had cats all my life until the last pair died of old age a couple of years ago . 

We live in a detached house with garden in Emmer Green , near Reading . 

I 'm sure my old cats ' vet would give references if requested . 

Please get in touch if you have kittens to offer . 

Tel : 07970 138329 By tilly ( 81.159.22.207 ) on Monday , May 08 , 2006 - 05:57 pm : she is very big but not got any babies yet. she is very promosing. we estimate at least 4 but u never know. will let u all know when the blessed event occurs thankyou By christina sanchez ( 82.35.68.236 ) on Monday , May 08 , 2006 - 01:24 pm : Hi there , myself and my husband are am trying to find a little sister for my 2yr old male cat . 

He has been nuetered chiped and is upto date with all his vaccines , any female would be spayed . 

We rescued him as a kitten and he has grown to be a loving cat , but he is affrad of the outside world , but very friendly with other cats . 

Even though I am at home most of the time and do play with him , he does get a bit bored . 

We think that an affectionate playmate would do him the world of good , but would need to have a home trial first . 

He was here first so if he did not get on with the new cat then we would have to return or rehome it . 

We would be willing to pay upto £30 ( we ca n't really offer more because we will need money for vaccines and spaying ) and are happy for a home visit , we live in North London , in a good sized 1 bed , first floor flat , off the main road , with a balcony and access to a communal garden . 

By Therese Nicholson ( 82.41.34.214 ) on Sunday , May 07 , 2006 - 09:30 pm : Hi Tilly , Therese again , hope your expectant mother is doing well .
