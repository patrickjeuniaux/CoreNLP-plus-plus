British Council Accreditation The Bury Language School is currently in the process of applying for British Council accreditation for 2006 . 

We strongly believe that this is the best way forward for The Bury Language School and the ELT industry as a whole in the current political climate . 

Not only will this move help students in their choice of language school , it will also aim to maintain and enhance our already high standards of education .
