Downer Bleach has an average rating of 7.50 based on 2 reviews drew All hype and pretense aside , Nirvana really is one of the best bands out there . 

This debut album is their weakest , which sounds worse than it is . 

It is outstanding and loved by many an underground-only fan . 

I do n't blame them for feeling alienated along with Kurt by the success of Nevermind . 

Whichever camp of fandom you 're from , Bleach is outstanding . 

10/10 Ollie Anyone who says this is the best Nirvana album - and there are a few - is a fool . 

I went to University with one such person ; I do n't talk to him anymore . 

It is very , very clearly not their best record . 

Why would anyone say otherwise ? 

To be obtuse ? 

To show an intelligence and understanding that other people can only guess at ? 

Or to show themselves to be a complete tit ? 

Yes , that one . 

The record does , however , have its moments ; Love Buzz being the most obvious . 

It is an interesting record in that it documents the pre-fame Kurdt ( sic ) , even if that does force us into the unavoidable conclusion that he feared most : fame suited him . 

Decent songs overall , though not the wall of sound that it was purported to be . 

A stepping-stone to greatness .
