Readers have reported another Web merchant selling " Coats of Arms " and " Distinguished Histories of Your Names " ~ Swyrich ~ but this appears at first sight to be a reincarnated Hall of Names ( of whose " Distinguished Histories " we have written before ) . 

The new site invites visitors to " Discover a Coat of Arms for Your Surname " and proclaims that We have authentic , full-color coats of arms for thousands of surnames of various nationalities . 

Swyrich coats of arms are crafted according to traditional heraldic standards . 

The first sentence is common to all the heraldry scams on the Internet , and can be ignored , but the second sentence is an affront to all genuine heraldic artists . 

As its principal example of " traditional heraldic standards " Swyrich offers a " Coat of Arms " for the name of Kerr . 

This attempts to illustrate the pronominal quarter of the Marquess of Lothian , Chief of the Kerr Clan . 

Placed above the shield is the helm of a gentleman , and around it some 19th century mantling ( the same that appears on all the Swyrich products ) . 

But the shield is of a totally inappropriate shape ( recently discussed in the Classical Heraldry articles ) , and the chevron has ridiculously sunk to its base ~ as if blazoned Gules and in base on a chevron Argent three mullets of the field , instead of Gules on a chevron Argent three mullets of the field . 

Don Pottinger 's portrayal of the Marquess 's arms uses the classical heater shape of shield , by far the best for a single coat , and depicts it couch√© ( aslant , technically " couched " ) with realistic mantling . 

He could have chosen to show the shield upright and to extend the mantling to both sides of the helm ( which is that of a peer ) .
