Pre Match Report Sid looking to stay in the swing Ryan Sidebottom claims the Notts players can’t wait to begin their defence of their Championship title . 

The 28-year-old said that the victory in the opening match of the season against the MCC was the final chapter in their 2005 celebrations . 

He added : “As far as we’re concerned we’re now starting with a blank sheet . 

You can’t get too carried away by success and we won’t be dwelling on last year. “We’re all focused on trying to win the Championship again and we can only do that by pushing on and looking to improve.” Sidebottom continued his form from 2005 with seven wickets against the MCC and hopes that will continue at Trent Bridge against his old club Yorkshire . 

He said : “Playing at Lord’s was a good way to get a run out in the middle against quality opposition . 

I found my rhythm early on and that’s a nice boost to confidence. “While the pitch was a good one , Trent Bridge usually offers a bit more swing so hopefully I can carry on and get some more wickets under my belt. “I won’t be treating Yorkshire any differently to any other game . 

Most of my friends in the squad have now moved on to pastures new . 

All I’m interested in is getting off to a good start and helping us get an early victory.” Squad : Bicknell , Gallian ( capt ) , Warren , Hussey , Will Smith , Read ( wkt ) , Ealham , Franks , Swann , Sidebottom , Greg Smith , Harris .
