" Like in most Chinese families , even in England here , both parents worked . 

They could not afford to hire help . 

My father , as I said , eventually ended up in Kingston where he had a wholesaler 's shop . 

And I do n't think he was a very good businessman . 

Apart from anything else he had a reputation for paying his bills the very day he received them , the invoices . 

And this was unusual enough for it to be commented on by the suppliers , who regarded him as one of their favourite customers . 

But as you can imagine it 's not the way to fame and fortune . 

But we benefitted from his nature , from his quiet way of teaching us how to conduct ourselves in private and in public life . 

And he has always been our lighthouse , our guide in the way we conduct ourselves . 

My mother was the more dominant personality and she 's the one who would tell us off if we did something wrong or would be the one who would nag at us to get our homework done . 

My father tended to keep very quiet . 

But we 're terribly fond of him .
