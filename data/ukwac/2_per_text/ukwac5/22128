I popped up to Auchterarder to my mum 's this weekend on the train with my bike . 

First time I 've taken a bike on a train ; it was nice and hassle-free . 

I still wonder what happens if there 's already a full complement of cyclists though . 

I went up on Friday night , on Saturday morning I headed off through Crieff and up past Loch Turret to climb Ben Chonzie . 

Loch Turret is a reservior for power generation , so there is a road from Crieff up to the dam at the end ( bit of a climb on a bike ) . 

There is also a rough track along the dam up to a Lochan right under Ben Chonzie , which I cycled up . 

That was fun , but illustrated how useful suspension is on a mountain bike , as it really was a rough , rocky track . 

Not much of a walk after that , the day was mostly a cycle . 

I took a wander up anyway , in shorts and T-Shirt in the slight rain , had a chat with the folk I met at the top , and wandered back down to cycle back . 

The great thing about a bike is , of course , that the energy which goes into slogging up a hill is returned when you go down again . 

The road down from the dam was fun ! 

I took a few pictures I like from under a bridge , just before the road up to the dam .
