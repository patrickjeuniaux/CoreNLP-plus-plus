just come back from the MOT station when I was told the car had failed on one item , the brake lights did not work , they were checked when I took it down as I was pulling out of the garge forecourt my wife flashed me to and said they worked as I stopped , I walked back to the tester and told him but his comment was they did not work on the rolling road so it was a failure he said the brake light switch needed adjusting I showed him they were working and after a heated disscussion I got a new MOT ticket. by the time we got home my wife said they came on occasionally depending how hard I braked ,so obviously the switch needs adjusting. but I cannot find any reference to it any of my workshop manuals anyone give me a clue ?

If not then , assuming that you still have the early relay unit fitted in the engine bay you could have a problem in this area . 

Do not leave the ignition on without the engine running for long .
