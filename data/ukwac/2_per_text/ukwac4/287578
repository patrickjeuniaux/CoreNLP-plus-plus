Background and General Interests The Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes has said ' the worst horrors in the world come from not being able to imagine the other ' . 

Fundamentally and ideally , I believe this is what a literary education is about – expanding our ability to imagine the other . 

Many years ago I did research in English , American and French nineteenth-century novels and my study of the American aspect appeared in my History , Ideology and Myth in American Fiction ( see below ) and other publications on James Fenimore Cooper and Dickens . 

Here I was particularly interested in how the novel in the early nineteenth century struggled to represent history , especially the history of the colonisation of Indian lands . 

Currently my main interests are embrace the development of modern society in the eighteenth-century , and thus the ' rise of the English novel ' from Defoe to Austen ( see Roxana Introduction ) and Austen 's Emma ( see Emma Introduction ) , but also the development of the city of London as a capitalist metropolis , and the influence of Locke 's thought and possessive individualism , landscape gardens and agricultural economics . 

I am currently most engaged in Jane Austen studies -- I am writing a study of her relation to agricultural enclosure and the modernisation of English social structures during the war with France ( 1792-1816 ) . 

I also have a longstanding interest in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic approaches to literature and film ( see my work on Fenimore Cooper in 1984 , my essay on The Piano , and on The English Patient below ) which appears in my teaching of psychoanalysis at undergraduate and postgraduate levels . 

I give an annual lecture series on modernism , which fascinates me more and more , and I also teach modern drama and postmodernism . 

Internationally I am known as a pioneer of electronic publishing , having designed , devloped and edited two internet publications which bring together the contributions of hundreds of scholars around the world ( see below ) . 

The kernel of my work can be put in this way : how do literary texts mobilise the fears and desires of the moment in which it was written , and the moment in which it is read ? 

In my writing and teaching I seek a better understanding of capitalist history down to the present : how power is mediated , how we recognise and misrecognise the world in which we live , how various social formations have come about , how they have formed the present , where we are now . 

To me Freud and Marx and those who have learned from them are most useful in this search . 

Britain , Europe and Professional Life During the last ten years I have given much time to fostering international scholarly relations , initially through helping to found the Council for University English ( 1988-92 ) , then through founding the European Society for the Study of English ( 1989-95 ) ( see ESSE ). This body now embraces scholars in 32 countries , has over eight thousand members and publishes an excellent twice-yearly magazine ( The European English Messenger ) and an academic journal , The European Journal for English Studies . 

My work in Europe led me to the development of electronic databases , notably the ESSE Membership Database ( see ESSE Database ) which provides detailed research profiles of higher education English teachers in Europe and is now the prime source for publisher 's mailing labels in English Studies . 

I continue to manage this database and produce an income for ESSE , part of which is used to fund an ESSE Postgraduate Fellowship at UEA . 

Since 1991 I have undertaken a range of reporting and committee activities for the European Commission , and co-ordinated a programme of SOCRATES / ERASMUS exchanges for the School which has enabled up to twenty students each year to study at one of our ten partner universities ( see ERASMUS ). Electronic Publishing Between 1996 and 2000 I developed a fully-indexed annotated bibliographic database , The Annotated Bibliography for English Studies ( see ABES . 

) which has to date published more than 6 million words in more than 35,000 entries ( the equivalent of 20 volumes of 500 pages ) . 

It currently updates monthly on the internet and is available from UEA library . 

I also devised and edit The Literary Encyclopedia at http://www.LitEncyc.com , an internet reference work which currently had over 20,000 incomplete entries and 1700 complete entries , and over 700 contributors . 

The Literary Encyclopedia aims to provide profiles of all major writers and their works , essays and glosses on critical terms , and information about the historical and cultural context of literary events . 

It has been published since October 2000 and will be sort of mature in 2005-6 . 

Teaching : I currently give two major lecture and seminar courses each year , in the autumn semester on Modernism ( see Modernism Dossier ) and in the spring semester on Eighteenth-Century Writing ( see Eighteenth Century Lectures ). Both courses provide high level introductions to major novelists and poets , philosophical issues and critical concepts . 

I also teach annual seminar courses on Modern Drama from Ibsen to Pinter ( see Drama Course Description , on Postmodernism : Fiction and Theory ( see Postmodernism Course Description ) , and on Literature and Desire for undergraduates ( see Literature and Desire Course Description ) and a similar course for MA students . 

These teach psychoanalytic approaches to texts as various as folk tales , Shakespearean drama and nineteenth century novels . 

I also try to take a hand in the Romanticism component of Literature and History . 

To help ensure good standards of presentation of written work , I have written The English Style Book .
