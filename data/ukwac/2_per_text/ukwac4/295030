The contractor building Wembley Stadium , Multiplex , has issued a statement which says the beleagured national stadium may not be ready to host a major event until June 2007 . 

Multiplex 's statement comes amid a new flurry of infighting between Multiplex and the venue 's owners Wembley National Stadium Ltd ( WNSL ) . 

On Monday ( 31 July ) , WNSL chief executive Michael Cunnah announced that the most recently discussed completion date , of September 2006 was unrealistic , placing the responsibility firmly on Multiplex . 

Cunnah said : " Multiplex still has major items to complete . 

For example , Multiplex has yet to finish the stadium 's roof , the extensive remedial works to the stadium 's drainage network and the installation of 10,000 of the stadium 's 90,000 seats . 

It has always been our view that the stadium 's delays are Multiplex 's responsibility . 

" In response , Multiplex placed a progress report this morning ( 1 August ) which insists that WNSL had not yet begun a number of ' client works ' which were essential , arguing that it was unable to achieve practical completion until WNSL had carried these works out . 

Multiplex added : " In the absence of a detailed programme having been provided by WNSL , Multiplex has conducted its own analysis of the programme to completion of the client works . 

" This has been based on Multiplex 's own assumptions of the current state of WNSL 's preparedness . 

The analysis has been reviewed with an expert in the operation of major stadia and indicates that it is unlikely that the stadium will be able to hold a test event for 90,000 spectators before June 2007 . 

" The latest round of arguments indicates that the acrimony surrounding the project shows no sign of abating and increases the likelihood of a High Court showdown between Multiplex and WNSL .
